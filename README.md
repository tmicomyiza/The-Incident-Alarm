## COMPLETED WORK:
Part one was correctly implemented

Part two: I implemented 
  NULL scan
  FIN scan
  Xmas scan
  NIkto Scan
  
## MISSING WORK:
  Usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear via HTTP Basic Authentication or FTP
  Someone scanning for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  
## COLLABORATORS:
  Fabrice and Ebere
  
 ## HOURS
  I spent around 10 hrs
  
 ## HEURISTICS
  I think the heuristics used are good. However, there is a room for improvement. I would make the code more modular.
  Additionally, improve it to detect other type of scans
